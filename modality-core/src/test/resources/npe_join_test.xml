Test for NPE at line 1032 in declareUpstreamJoin.
The author entity has no explicit table= but has sqlPrimaryKey.
The entity name will be used to guess the table name (AUTHOR) which doesn't exist.
Since there's no explicit table=, the error path is different:
- entity.setTable(null) is called instead of throwing ConfigurationException
- Entity stays in knownEntitiesByTable
- sqlPrimaryKey is set so getJoins() doesn't bail early
- But getPrimaryKey() returns null because no columns
- declareUpstreamJoin NPEs at line 1032
